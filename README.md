A spatial body physics simulator, more or less based on Newton's gravitational law.  
Click and drag to create new objects.
These keys modify what you create if they're pressed at the moment of releasing the mouse:
- `alt`: make the object unmovable
- `shift`: double the object's starting speed
- `meta` (Cmd on macOS): double the object's starting speed
- `x`: instead of creating a single object, create multiple very small ones
- `a`: create a speedless object
- `s`: toggle slow motion (the slider under the canvas is used to choose how much to slow it down, in the range \[1.1x, 20x\]

Press T to toggle image persistence (enabled by default), and P to pause or resume.  
Shift and Meta may be combined or used separately; for example, pressing both will give the object 4x speed, while pressing only one will give it only 2x speed.
